 In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?
When you’re working with very simple databases or just testing a database without setting up an entire database engine.

Think back to what you learned in the Immersion course. What do you think about the differences between JavaScript and Python as programming languages?
The syntax feels a bit more literal at times, and it is easier to follow the logic in the code.
 
Now that you’re nearly at the end of Achievement 1, consider what you know about Python so far. What would you say are the limitations of Python as a programming language?
Slower than JavaScript and doesn’t seem to be used a lot in Android/iOS app development, and doesn’t run in browsers.
