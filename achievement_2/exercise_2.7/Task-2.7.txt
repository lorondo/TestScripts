Task-2.7
I want to keep it somewhat simple and allow the user to search for an ingredient and see the recipes in our database that utilize this ingredient. Kind of like a last minute meal search when you're prepping for a meal and going off of the things you just happen to have in your kitchen.

Data Analysis
The charts will see how many recipes are in the database vs the number of recipes in the database that utilize the searched ingredient. The x-axis is the number of recipes and the y-axis is the ingredient searched.
