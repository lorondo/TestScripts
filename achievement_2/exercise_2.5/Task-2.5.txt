Task-2.5
I didn't see much of a reason to alter much that was already established. The only thing I went in and added to give a little more for the recipes was the include a pics section so that I could display what a finished product may look like of a given recipe.

I liked the blocking of these sites, how everything is compartmentalized, as well as the minimalist approach to their design. I wanted to incorporate a navbar on my own as well as a backdrop image that would guide the visitor to the next page where the recipes are listed.
